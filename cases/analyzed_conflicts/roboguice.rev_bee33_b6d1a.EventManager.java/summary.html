        <li>Left
            <ul>
                <li>modified signature to make use of generics. Type: Class â†’ Class<T>

        <li>Right modified body

        <li>Safe reported conflict between one version and empty. Kept all other versions.
        <li>MergeMethods reported no conflict
        <li>KeepBothMethods kept both versions of method. FN: do not compile, as they have same erasure.
    </ul>
    <li>void unregisterObserver(Context context, Object instance, Class event) <ul>
        <li>Very similar to registerObserver. Difference: MergeMethods reported conflict on body</li>
