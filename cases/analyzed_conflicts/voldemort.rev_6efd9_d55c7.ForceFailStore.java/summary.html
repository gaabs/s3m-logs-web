    <li>public ForceFailStore(Store<K, V> innerStore) <ul>
        <li>Left modified body and added overloaded constructors
        <li>Right modified signature parameter type: Store<K, V> â†’ Store<K, V, T>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: Class was also modified from "ForceFailStore<K, V> extends DelegatingStore<K, V>" to "ForceFailStore<K, V, T> extends DelegatingStore<K, V, T>"
            </ul>
        <li>Unstructured reported conflict between closest versions
        <li>Safe reported conflict between closest versions
        <li>MergeMethods merged most similar versions
            <ul>
                <li>Note: FN was introduced, as now some constructors use Store<K, V> and others use Store<K, V, T> and no conflict was reported
            </ul>
        <li>KeepBothMethods kept all versions of constructor <ul>
